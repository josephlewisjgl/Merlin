# Merlin

Merlin will be a Chatbot that can take requests from users to search for and retrieve data and information from StatsWales. Merlin has begun to learn how to understand users and now you can try and ask questions using your own words, fall back phrases that Merlin definitely understands are below and can be found in the help menu.

## At the moment Merlin can:

### 1. Search for a dataset based on one or more keywords.

To access this function use:

*search school ethnicity*

Merlin will curate a list of all the cubes that match the key terms searched for and return their title and cube number.

### 2. Give you a brief description of a specific data cube from StatsWales metadata.

*describe econ0074*

Will return a brief message from Merlin who will describe the cube for you using the metadata provided on StatsWales.

### 3. Download your data for you.

*download econ0074*

Merlin will begin a download process for you on the dataset with the ID provided, there will then be a prompt from Merlin for the file path you would like to store the data under and Merlin will use it to store your data as a .csv file.

### 4. Get a piece of data for you.

*get data for econ0074*

Merlin will download a dataset for you to query, you will be prompted to tell Merlin which features you would like to filter and how you would like to filter them before Merlin sums the appropriate data for your query.

## Extra keywords:

### To close Merlin:

Other commands also work like 'no', 'goodbye' and more.
